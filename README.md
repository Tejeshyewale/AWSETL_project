# AWSETL_project Theory of Services used 
Build a serverless ETL pipeline using AWS Glue to process and analyze CSV data stored in S3 with Athena.
1. AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)
â€¢	What is it? 
o	Object storage service that provides scalable, secure, and high-performance storage.
â€¢	Key Features: 
o	Stores data as objects in buckets.
o	Highly available, durable, and cost-effective.
o	Supports multiple storage classes (Standard, IA, Glacier, etc.).
o	Queryable with Athena (without moving data).
o	Integrated with AWS Glue for ETL processes.
â€¢	Use Cases: 
o	Data lake storage.
o	Backup and archival.
o	Hosting static websites.

2. AWS Glue
â€¢	What is it? 
o	A fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service that prepares data for analytics.
â€¢	Key Components: 
o	Glue Crawler: Automatically scans S3 and creates metadata in the Glue Data Catalog.
o	Glue Data Catalog: Stores metadata for structured/semi-structured data.
o	Glue Jobs: Runs transformations using PySpark or Python shell scripts.
â€¢	Key Features: 
o	Serverless (scales automatically).
o	Supports schema inference.
o	Can integrate with Athena, Redshift, and RDS.
o	Supports partitioning and cataloging for better performance.
â€¢	Use Cases: 
o	Cleaning and transforming raw data from S3.
o	Automating data pipelines for machine learning.
o	Migrating and preparing data for analytics.

3. AWS Athena
â€¢	What is it? 
o	A serverless query service to analyze data directly from S3 using SQL.
â€¢	Key Features: 
o	Uses Presto (open-source SQL engine).
o	Queries data without loading it into a database.
o	Supports structured and semi-structured formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, ORC).
o	Works with Glue Data Catalog for metadata management.
o	Pay-per-query pricing model (cost-efficient).
â€¢	Use Cases: 
o	Ad-hoc querying of large datasets in S3.
o	Log analysis and reporting.
o	Business intelligence and analytics.

How They Work Together
1.	Store raw data in S3 â†’ (data lake storage).
2.	Use AWS Glue Crawler â†’ (automatically infer schema & create metadata in Glue Data Catalog).
3.	Run AWS Glue Jobs â†’ (clean and transform data if needed).
4.	Query data using Athena â†’ (run SQL queries directly on S3 without moving data).
This combination is widely used for big data analytics and serverless data pipelines. ðŸš€
